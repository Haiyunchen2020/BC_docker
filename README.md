# BC_docker
Create a container management tool from scratch in C or C++ that launches a Linux container and is able to run users’ Linux applications in the container. Let’s call this container management tool BCDocker. The tool should meet the following requirements. The usage of the tool mirrors the popular container management tool Docker; however, in this project, we only implement a small subset of it. An application container is a package of applications and all of their dependencies. Multiple containers on a host share the same underlying operating system kernel. First and foremost, the tool must be a container management tool.
